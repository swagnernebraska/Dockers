This Docker Compose configuration sets up Filebrowser with the following key components:

1) It uses the latest Filebrowser image.
2) The container is named "filebrowser".
3) Three volumes are mapped:
   /home:/srv: This maps your local /home directory to /srv in the container, where Filebrowser will manage files1.
   ./filebrowser.db:/database/filebrowser.db: This stores the Filebrowser database file12.
    ./settings.json:/config/settings.json: This maps the settings file for Filebrowser12.
4) Environment variables PUID and PGID are set to match the current user's ID and group ID for proper file permissions12.
5) Port 8080 on the host is mapped to port 80 in the container12.
6) The container is set to restart unless stopped manually.

Before running this configuration, make sure to create the filebrowser.db and settings.json files in the same directory as your docker-compose.yml file2. You can create these files using the following commands:
touch filebrowser.db
touch settings.json

For JSON
{
  "port": 80,
  "baseURL": "",
  "address": "",
  "log": "stdout",
  "database": "/database/filebrowser.db",
  "root": "/srv"
}

After setting up these files, you can start Filebrowser by running docker-compose up -d in the directory containing your docker-compose.yml file12.
