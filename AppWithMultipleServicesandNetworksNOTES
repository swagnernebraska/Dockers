networks: Defines a custom network named app-network.

app: Uses a pre-built image, exposes port 8080, and mounts a local directory as a volume.

redis: Uses the Redis Alpine image and connects to the custom network.

nginx: Uses the Nginx image, exposes port 80, connects to the custom network, and mounts a local Nginx configuration file.

depends_on is used to make sure the app service starts before the nginx service.
