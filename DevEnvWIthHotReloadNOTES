Dockerfile.dev: A Dockerfile specifically for development, installing dependencies and setting up hot reloading.

Mounts the current directory into the container, allowing code changes on the host to reflect in the container.
Mounts an anonymous volume for node_modules to avoid conflicts with the host's node_modules.
